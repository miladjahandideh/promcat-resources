# Fluentd
Fluentd is an open source data collector, which lets you unify the data collection and consumption for a better use and understanding of data.


# Prometheus and exporters
Fluentd already has a Prometheus endpoint with all the metrics exposed on the port 24231. In Kubernetes the pod is already annotated, so Prometheus can scrape the endpoint right away.
