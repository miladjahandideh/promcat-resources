# Istio
Istio can do the following:

* Intelligently control the flow of traffic and API calls between services, conduct a range of tests, and upgrade gradually with red/black deployments.
* Automatically secure your services through managed authentication, authorization, and encryption of communication between services.
* Apply policies and ensure that they are enforced and the resources are fairly distributed among consumers.
* See what's happening with rich automatic tracing, monitoring, and logging of all your services.

# Prometheus and exporters
Istio already provides a Prometheus and a Grafana servers with all the metrics you need to monitor.
